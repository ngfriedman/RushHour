I put the pieces in an array list also but maybe they dont need to be because of the PIECES spritegroup? 
UPDATE THE PIECES CAN MOVE
-nina

Things we should do:

Make lego background to size

add all the pieces

make pieces move

put pieces in arraylist

set up and if statement thing where the pieces can't collide

set up if statement where piece cant make it out of bounds (collision)

set up if statement where pieces can ex. only move horizontal (if width is greater than height you can only change x)
lable pieces with arrows so you know which direction they can move

set up something where each piece is represented by a key on the keyboard, and clicking the key activates the piece

IF ABOVE DOESNT WORK: work with the gui interface(program other than emacs)
